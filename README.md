# Industrial Robots Simulation in MATLAB & Simulink

## Overview
This repository provides a collection of simulations for different industrial robots including PUMA, SCARA, and Stanford arms, using MATLAB and Simulink. The parts for each robot are modeled in SolidWorks and imported into MATLAB for advanced simulation, with a focus on solving inverse kinematics. These simulations help to analyze and visualize robot movements, improve efficiency, and assist in controlling the robotic arms for automation tasks.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB (preferably the latest version)
- Simulink
- SolidWorks (for robot part modeling)
- MATLAB Simscape Multibody (for the robot's simulation environment)
- Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB (for inverse kinematics calculations)

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- MATLAB Robotics Toolbox
- Simulink 3D Animation (if visualization is required)
- SolidWorks for creating and exporting the CAD models
